CMake build conversion of CODA-oss

August 2018, Scott.Colcord@RadiantSolutions.com

CODA-oss now contains a prototype of a CMake-based build system.

This is stil a work-in-progress, but should be ready for users of CODA-oss to use for testing purposes.

Requirements:
* CMake >= 3.11, configured with "--qt-gui" if the qt gui is desired.

Files:
* ./CMakeLists.txt - Most of the code is here.
* ./config_coda.csh - Configuration script
* ./build_coda.csh - Build script (generated by config_coda.csh)
* ./build/config_tests.cmake - Utility code for compile and library configuration tests.
* ./modules/.../CMakeLists.txt - Project specific options and settings.
* ./modules/.../include/.../*.cmake.in - Templates for generating config header files.
* ./target - Default location for build artifacts
* ./install - Default location for installed files

Instructions for Linux:

* Execute config_coda.csh.
* config_coda.csh will run the configure stage, and create 'build_coda.csh'.
* build_coda.csh will launch the build.  -j<n> can be specified to parallelize the build.
* Note that as described below, the first configure+build will build the drivers, but not the dependent modules.  Subsequent configure+builds will use the already-built drivers to build the dependent modules.
** Consequently, users should generally not clean the driver build outputs (and shouldn't need to, since the drivers don't usually change).


Instructions for Windows:

* Open the directory containing the top-level CMakeLists.txt as a project in Visual Studio.


This system has a few differences from the waf-based system:

* Rather than selectively building subsets of files from the 3rd-pary (drivers) packages, it just builds them using their normal build processes.  This should reduce the labor overhead and risk of breaking the build when updating driver package versions.


Implementation Notes:

Build configuration selection on Linux is awkward, and requires editing the script.  The Qt-based GUI for CMake may be able to help with this (needs investigation)
On Windows, Visual Studio's configuration selector can pick the desired configuration.

Most of the smarts are in the root-level CMakeLists.txt file.  See the in-code comments there for details.
There are some utility .cmake files in the ./build directory

The CODA_BUILD_TESTS variable in the script controls whether tests will be built.

Currently, the scripts reduce the compile warning level to reduce distractions while working on this project; this should be reversed for production use.


TODO list:
* Test other build configurations.  This should just require changing $build_type in config_coda.csh, but there will no doubt be bugs and rough edges.
* Test the shared library build.  This should just require changing $build_lib_type in config_coda.csh, but there will no doubt be bugs and rough edges.
* There will need to be many configuration options added to match the waf options.
