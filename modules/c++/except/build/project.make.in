DESCRIPTION = This library defines a set of exceptions, and errors, \
              throwables which can be caught and manipulated within \
              the constructs of the C++ langaguge.  \
              When used in conjunction with the sys package, this \
              library is a necessity, and because of its simple, \
              java-like exception hierarchy, it is easy to understand.
