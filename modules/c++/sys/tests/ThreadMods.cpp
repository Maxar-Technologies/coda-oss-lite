/* Okay, here is the problem
 *
 *  Once I do a copy, my runnable target is copied over, 
 *  but Im supposed to be pointing at myself.
 *  So if I make T1 at address 0xbf, it then points at itself
 *  with the runnable, and so I have
 *
 *  0xbf: [T1] -> mTarget = 0xbf
 *  But if I copy T1 to T2...
 *  0xbc: [T2] -> mTarget = T1.mTarget = 0xbf
 *      -- I really want (in this case) mTarget pointing at T2's address
 *  Now I have a shallow copy which is very dangerous
 *
 *  This can be verified by applying the following method:
 *
 * 	ThreadPosix(const ThreadPosix& p) 
	{
	  std::cout << "Copying constructing thread" << std::endl;
	  mName      = p.mName;
	  mPriority  = p.mPriority;
	  mTarget    = this;
	  printf("mTarget = %p\n", mTarget);
	  printf("p.mTarget = %p\n", p.mTarget);
	  mIsRunning = p.mIsRunning;
	}
 *  Note that instead of assigning mTarget to p.mTarget, I have assigned
 *  it to this.  Note further that this may be highly undesirable behavior,
 *  if a thread is attempting to run a child.  In that case it should be
 *  mTarget = p.mTarget;
